## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The advantage of R Markdown is that you can intersperse your text with your code and output with your ordinary text.  This makes it easier to create nicely formatted reports, showing both the statistical analysis and the written discussion.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded code chunks within the document:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Code Chunks

The "grey areas" above are called *code chunks*.  This means that R Markdown understands anything you write inside them to be code that should be executed by the computer.

Notice that this does not calculate a mean:

mean(1:10)

but this does:

```{r}
mean(1:10)
```

What about this?

```{r}
# mean(1:10)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Knitting

You do **not** have to knit the file to save it.  You can save your .Rmd  (R Markdown file) in the ordinary ways:  File > Save, or Control + S, or clicking the disk icon.

When you knit the file, the following happens:

* The text is formatted nicely according to your *Markdown* usage.
* The code chunks are all run, in order, from scratch.
* A .html file is automatically created with the finished product.

This means the order of your code chunks is very important!  You might run code in a different order when you are interacting with your notebook, but this won't help you when it comes to knitting.

```{r, error = TRUE}
mean(a)
a <- 1:5
```



## Packages

Some of the work we do will require external packages - i.e., new code sources that allow us to do even more in R and RStudio.  

Each new package only needs to be installed once per computer or per RStudio Cloud account:

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
```

*(Why do you think I have commented out this line of code?  Hint: What happens
when we knit the file?)*

But each package you use in a particular analysis needs to be announced before being used:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Chunk labels and options

The most important part of a chunk is the basic structure, that tells R Markdown
"here comes some code":

```{r}

```

You can also give your chunks names, which will help you navigate your document:

```{r adding}
1 + 1
```

```{r subtracting}
1 - 1
```

Look out!  Chunks can not have duplicate names!!!  Try changing the second chunk 
above to also be named "adding", then knit your document.


There are also many many options that let you determine the appearance of the chunk
in your document.  Try to figure out what the following will do:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
1 + 1
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(, aes(x = 1:10)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r, error = FALSE}
"hi" + 1
```

## Optional: Python

Although R Markdown was initially built for R, it now supports many languages, including python.

To set up your computer or RStudio Cloud account to use python, run the following.

```{r}
# install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```

Next, install python itself:

```{r}
#install_miniconda()
```


You can also install your favorite python packages via a reticulate shortcut function called `py_install`:

```{r}
#py_install("pandas")
#py_install("seaborn")
```

Now you're all set!  Simply make a chunk of the type `python` instead of the type
`r` to run python code:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')
iris.head()
iris['sepal_length'].plot()
```
