```{r libraries, include = FALSE}
#### you can ignore this for now!
library(tidyverse)

1.  Write the names of your group members below, as a bullet point list.


2.  Find something that all of you enjoy for fun.  Insert a related picture or meme below.


3.  Each of you, choose a favorite color from [this list](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).
Each of you share how comfortable you are with R on a scale of 1-10.

Edit the code below so that it has your names and corresponding

```{r group_info}
group_data <- tibble(
  names = c("Person 1", "Person 2", "Person 3", "Person 4"),
  colors = c("goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod"),
  comfort = c(1, 3, 10, 5)
)
```

4. Click "Knit" and see the plot that is produced.

(Do not edit the code chunk below!)

```{r group_plot}
group_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = names, y = comfort, fill = names)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = group_data$colors)
```

5.  Now, everyone decide your comfort level on a scale of 1-10 in python, and your favorite colors from [this](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html) list.

```{python group_info_py}
group_data = {
  'names': ["Person 1", "Person 2", "Person 3", "Person 4"], 
  'colors': ["goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod"],
  'comfort': [1, 3, 10, 5]
  }
```

```{python group_plot_py}
plt.bar(x = group_data['names'], height = group_data['comfort'], color = group_data['colors'])
plt.ylabel("Comfort with python")
plt.show()
```
