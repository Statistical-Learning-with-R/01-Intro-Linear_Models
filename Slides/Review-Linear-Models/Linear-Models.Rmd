# Linear Models

# Modeling

Recall:  We are assuming that

.center[.huge[
(**output**) = .blue[f](**input**) + (noise)
]]

and we would like to estimate .blue[f].

# Linear Model


$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$$


Goal:  Use observations $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ to estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$.

# Measures of success

What is the "best" choice of $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$?

--

* The ones that are **statistically most justified**, under certain assumptions about $Y$ and $X$?

--

* The ones that minimize the prediction error?

    + $|\hat{y}_i - y_i|$?
    + $(\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2$?
    + $(\hat{y}_i - y_i)^4$?
    
--

* The ones that minimize the prediction error *on new information*?

    + $|y_{new} - \hat{y}_{new}|$?
    + $(y_{new} - \hat{y}_{new})^2$?
    + $(y_{new} - \hat{y}_{new})^4$?

# Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)


Let's assume $X$ is **Normally distributed** with some mean and variance.

Let's assume that $Y$ *given* $X$ is **Normally distributed** with a mean of $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X$ and some variance.

--

* Based on our data, what do we think are the mean and variance of $X$?

* Based on our data, what do we think are the mean and variance of $Y$?

* Based on our data, what is our *best guess* about $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$?

--

What if $Y$ was **Exponentially distributed**?  **Poisson?** **Bernoulli**????

# MSE/SSE/RSE/RMSE

The **residual** of a model is how much you "missed" by:

$y_i - \hat{y_i}$


--

The **squared residual**, or **squared error** is that squared:


$(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$

---

# MSE/SSE/RSE/RMSE

The **sum of squared error (SSE)** is all those added up:


sum over all $i$ of $(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$

--


This is also called the **residual squared error (RSE)** or **residual sum of squares (RSS)**.

--

*(Yes, those are all the same thing.  Statistics is silly sometimes.)*


---
# MSE/SSE/RSE/RMSE


The **mean squared error (MSE)** is all those added up and then averaged:


sum over all $i$ of $(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$ divided by $n$

---


The **root mean squared error (RMSE)** is the square root of the MSE:


sum over all $i$ of $(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$ divided by $n$, then square root it


---

# MSE/SSE/RSE/RMSE

**What's the point of all this?**

--

If we decide the "best" $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the ones that minimize the **MSE**...

--

that's exactly the same as minimizing the **RMSE**, the **RSS**, the **SSE**, the **RSE**!

--

These are all measuring "how far are our predictions from the truth, in squared distance?"

--

**NOT** the same as "absolute" error ($|y_i - \hat{y_i}|$)

# Checkpoint:

## Before any modeling analysis, you have to decide what your definition of the .large[BEST MODEL] is!

# Linear model estimates

For linear models (but not *every* model!) the "best" model according to the (Normal) **MLE** and the "best" model according to the **MSE** agree!


--

Okay, so how do we calculate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$?

# Get the idea, not the math

**What you DON'T need to know:**

* What mathematical equations are used to compute $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$.

* What statistical properties your estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ have.

* How the computer efficiently does these calculations.

--

**What you DO need to know:**

* How to make a computer do the calculations

* Which measure of model success lead to this estimation choice

* How to interpret the results in the real world.
